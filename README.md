# Route Generation with multiple stops 

JavaScript code that can track vehicles using their GPS location, it also can generate multiple routes for them and send it to them. 
Visuals are not very good, CSS and HTML only. 
Uses firebase as DataBase to load/send routes and know the vehicles location.
